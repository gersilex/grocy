- Fixed that barcode lookups now compare the whole barcode, not parts of it (e. g. when you have two products with the barcodes "$1" and "$10" and scan "$1" maybe the product of "$10" was found till now)
- It's now possible to display a recipe directly from the meal plan (new "eye button") (thanks @kriddles)
- Improved the responsiveness of the meal plan and calendar page by automatically switching to a day calendar view on smaller screens (thanks for the idea @kriddles)
- The calendar now also contains all planned recipes from the meal plan on the corresponding day
- When adding a product to the shopping list from the new context/more menu from the stock overview page and if the product is already on the shopping list, the amount of that entry will be updated acccordingly instead of adding a new (double) shopping list item
- Fixed that the browser barcode scanner button was not clickable on iOS Safari (thanks @DeeeeLAN)
- Fixed a problem regarding quantity unit conversion handling for recipe ingredients of products with no unit relations, but only a different purchase/stock quantity unit
- Improved that dates in the iCal calendar export now includes the server timezone
- It's now also possible to set the meal plan page as the default/entry page (`config.php` setting `ENTRY_PAGE`) (thanks @lwis)
- The API Endpoint `GET /files/{group}/{fileName}` now also returns a `Cache-Control` header (defaults fixed to 30 days) to further increase page load times
- Fixed that the API endpoint `/stock/shoppinglist/add-product` failed when a product should be added which was not already on the shopping list (thanks @Forceu)
- Some style/CSS detail-refinements
